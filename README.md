## 🍼 About

Welcome to my digital nursery! I'm Umay, currently residing in my mom's belly with terrible WiFi signal 📶. Despite the connectivity issues and having to code with one hand (the other is busy thumb-sucking 👍), I managed to build this website to:

- 📅 Count down to my arrival (September 5, 2025)
- 🎁 Accept early "investments" for my startup (aka baby gifts)
- 🐾 Support HAYTAP for our paw friends
- 📊 Share live updates from the womb

## ✨ Features

### 🎮 Main Features
- **Bilingual Support** (Turkish/English) - Because I'm already multilingual!
- **Live Countdown** - Real-time countdown to my birth date
- **Womb Dashboard** - Live stats including current status, size comparison, and recent activities
- **Developer Console** - Shows `npm install life@1.0.0` with remaining days
- **Investment Tiers** - Angel Investor, Venture Capital, and Unicorn packages
- **Donation Integration** - Bank transfer and QR code payment options
- **HAYTAP Support** - Because paw friends deserve love too!

### 🎨 Design Features
- Fully responsive (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, 4K)
- Animated elements and micro-interactions
- Gradient animations and playful hover effects
- Baby-themed humor throughout
- "Beta" badges and version numbers (currently v0.9, v1.0 releases at birth!)
